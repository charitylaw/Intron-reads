# Supplementary Figures

**Sup Fig 1 - Between library comparisons.pdf** : Comparing RNA protocols for gene-level exon log-CPM (left) and gene-level intron log-CPM values (right) for human cell line HCC827 R1, R2, R3, human cell line NCI-H11975 R1, R2, and R3 (in order of plots shown).

**Sup Fig 2 - Intron length.pdf** On a log2-scale, the relative length of introns compared to exons are plotted against the length of introns. The exon length of a gene is calculated as the sum of all exon regions as defined in the exon annotation; similarly for intron length. Log-values are calculated using an offset of 0.001. 

**Sup Fig 3 - Within library comparisons.pdf** : From left to right, intron versus exon log-CPM, intron versus exon log-RPKM, intron log-RPKM versus total intron length, relative coverage between exon and intron regions versus total intron length, and relative coverage versus exon log-RPKM; with poly(A) RNA (top row) and Total RNA libraries (bottom row). The plots are displayed for human cell line HCC827 R1, R2, R3, human cell line NCI-H11975 R1, R2, and R3 (in order of plots shown).

**Sup Fig 4 - Superintronic summary values.png**: Scatterplot matrix of summary values from running superintronic on the poly(A) RNA HCC827 cell line, with associated density plots for exon mean (exon_mn), intron mean (intron_mn), intron standard deviation (intron_sd) and number of intron bases above the threshold. More details can be found in the [superintronic vignette](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sa-lee/analysis-superintronic/blob/master/Rmd/01-superintronic.html)

**Overlap in intron retention methods.png**: UpSet plot showing overlap between superintronic and other intron retention methods. More details can be found in the [overlaps vignette](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sa-lee/analysis-superintronic/blob/master/Rmd/03-overlaps.html)

**Overlap in novel methods.png**: UpSet plot showing overlap between superintronic and index. More details can be found in the [overlaps vignette](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sa-lee/analysis-superintronic/blob/master/Rmd/03-overlaps.html).

**Coverage Plots** : Directory links for results from superintronic, IRfinder and IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR on poly(A) RNA libraries. Genes are named by GENCODE gene ID.
